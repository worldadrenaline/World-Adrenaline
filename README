World Adrenaline is a web application for importing, searching and selling adventure activities. Sort of a kayak.com but for adventure activities.

The software is written in CakePHP and is designed to import feeds of adventure operators and adventure activities from various adventure activity distribution companies. These operators and activities are then searchable on the site and the customer should be able to purchase or click through to purchase one of the activities.
